Step 3 : Install all supporting plugins - TestNG, REST Assured.

Step 4: Add Selenium JARs to the Java Project in Eclipse.

Step 5: Install and Launch Eclipse which is an IDE for writing code.

Step 6: Create Workspace in Eclipse.

Step 7: Create New Java Project in the Workspace.

Step 8: Create Package and Class under the Java Project.

Step 9: Build the Project once to verify the setup is working fine.
